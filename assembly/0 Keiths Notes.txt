Extras:
  - WD40 White Lithium Greece (spray can)
    - I used as lubricate for linear rails and screw
  - Locktight Blue for grub screws

Purchase notes:

I bought from Aliexpress and didn't see extrusion options. I did consider CNC but went away as at least 1 foot had to be plastic and original designs were ABS incase wanted to mod later.
  - Went black and red (expect most common).
    - Kit had note saying: Sunlu red + sublu black

---
Parts:
  - From (1):
    Extrusion A=B (All tapped)
    C=H
  - The Kirigami bed deprecates:
      - 100mm "F Extrusion" x2 (end M3)
      - 100mm "G Extrusion" x1 (27.5x2 same face)
      ~ page 38 (note says to skip to page 43)
  - There are separate extrusions in the kit for the lid

  - p21 
      > These were leavered arms in first tray
  - p36 'Frame - Component Prep' this is all bed tray
    > MOD: Have Kirigami which mentions skip (on p38) but is here
      - These two parts are part of metal tray for Kirigami.
      - A Kirigami v0 install video is at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOnNvhircn8&ab_channel=MapleLeafMakers
        - I have v0.2 which has some mods coming up:
      - The part on p36 is deprecated:
        - It WAS 'VORON v0.0_v0.1_legacy_chain_mount.stl
'https://github.com/christophmuellerorg/voron_0_kirigami_bed/blob/master/STL/VORON%20v0.0_v0.1_legacy_chain_mount.stl with install guidance on at 7:27
        - I had BLACK 'Voron_0.2_stealth_chain_mount.stl'  https://github.com/christophmuellerorg/voron_0_kirigami_bed
        - This is installed like: https://github.com/christophmuellerorg/voron_0_kirigami_bed/blob/master/Images/stealth_beta.png
        - NB: My dragchain ends were same, the v0.1 mentions one goes BOTH ways and use that on tray
      - There is another BLACK part which is shown in red on https://github.com/christophmuellerorg/voron_0_kirigami_bed/blob/master/Images/stealth_beta.png
        - This needed 1x M3 heat insert and 4x M3x6 BHCS
      - Keep the lead screw with anti-back lash mount attached until mouting z-axis motor.
          - The part shown in RED with the Z was BLACK in my kit
          - Mount with the horizontal part at top (I originally did bottom and notied at p92 - leasily swapped)
        - Electronics used 3x6
      >> Returns to manual after attached p47 (covered by https://github.com/christophmuellerorg/voron_0_kirigami_bed/blob/master/Images/stealth_beta.png)

  - p49-51; have an update to z endmount stops in 0.2 R1 upgrade
      - this is shown in (5) as z endstop mount; the red one with frowny eye-brows
      - uses 2x M2x10 self tapping from switch outside. Red switch on RHS from front
      - then tried M3x8 BHCS into frame
    - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zX7Bgzhw0OM&list=WL&index=4&ab_channel=KanduWorkshop @3:37 shows a red part;

  - p53; I added extra 2 nuts to allow for 5VPSU mounting in fuure if required (kit has all in 1 board)

  - p70; shims M3x6x0.5
    Spacer is red ~10mm

  - 81 used lock-tight on grub screws

  - 92 for Kirigami skip this; will mount with lead screws from motor to tray in p104
    - From TODO the mount should be attached to tray as in https://github.com/christophmuellerorg/voron_0_kirigami_bed/blob/master/Images/stl_mounting.png 
    - Kept the lead screw attachment connected to the lead screw but if unattached wait until p104 (as will lubricate)
      - This is consistent with:
        - 0.1 tray upgrade: https://3dpandme.com/2022/03/12/funssor-kirigami-bed-upgrade-for-the-voron-0-1/
        - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zX7Bgzhw0OM&list=WL&index=4&ab_channel=KanduWorkshop at 4:21

  - p95 NB 4xM3 nuts on back right virtical, confirm at p97
  - p103 foot accents were in red

-----

 >>> 104
  - You will need to remove lead screw to mount red plate
    - I used white lithium greece; same as linear rails

       - If need to reattach have tallest part facing up:
            - See https://www.youtube.com/shorts/Y4ScC2dLlLY (linked from manual p92)


  Add nutes to allow for carry handles on next extrusions
