TODO:
	1. Continue with PDF (p21/30)
		- Extruder tuning
		- Setup Cura including Octoprint

	2. Continue with: https://jjarrard.github.io/Gemini-V3-Flash-Voron-V0/installation/
		- Anything on z-offset
		- Anything on z-homing
		- Anything on Z stop at bottom but home to top??

	3. Redo PIF Tuning
	4. Initial test print

	- Accelerometer - input shaping

	- Backup my config files -> My GIT
	- Cleanup notes and host somewhere -> my git

STRETCH:

	- Image SD card then try updating

	- Try copying configs of other SD card

	- Check BED LED - old FW used it
		https://docs.siboor.com/other-products/led-effect-notes/installing-led-effects-software


FUTURE:
	- See if any recommended USB cameras
		- Missing one of my logitect; did try 2 other

		- Do NOT update
			Due to server issues, please do not update the system or klipper arbitrarily
			Please download FLY OS system, installing the original Armbian is too difficult and not recommended

		- Follow from: https://mellow.klipper.cn/en/docs/ResDownload/system-img/fly-Gemini

On MBP
	- Connecting USB cable did power on board 
		- Don't power through USB hub - used dock
		- This was USB C closer to ethernet port 'USB3'
	- Detect Port:
		ls /dev/*usb*
		/dev/cu.usbserial-230	/dev/tty.usbserial-230
		Note:
			- From: https://pbxbook.com/other/mac-tty.html#screen
			  Suggest using cu:
				TTY devices are for calling into UNIX systems.
				CU (Call-Up) devices are for calling out from them (eg, modems).
				We want to call-out from our Mac, so /dev/cu.* is the correct device to use.

				The technical difference is that /dev/tty.* devices will wait (or listen) for DCD (data-carrier-detect), eg, someone calling in, before responding. /dev/cu.* devices do not assert DCD, so they will always connect (respond or succeed) immediately.
			- However ChatCPT screen example uses tty

		https://github.com/Jjarrard/Gemini-V3-Flash-Voron-V0/tree/main/Config%20Files

	- Used screen connecting to cu port at 115200
		screen /dev/cu.usbserial-230 115200

		This will drop into a console shell: root@flygemin

	- Front Display
		- FYI There is a similar HW (LDO Motors v0.1) at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a66HdK4VCd8

			Note:
				1. https://community.particle.io/t/solved-dfu-util-error-during-download-get-status-error-writing-firmware/13329

				dfu-util has known issue where it both reports success and failure. (See lines mentioning done and success, and the last line mentioning error.) You can ignore this error, the tool is lying to yo

			Similar with:
				make flash FLASH_DEVICE=0483:df11
				Also with Sudo
			sudo reboot
			< I then removed jumper and pressed display reset PB and it all worked :) >


STRETCH:
	- Look at any dmesg warnigs

	- Suggest do NOT do apt updates on this image: https://www.reddit.com/r/VORONDesign/comments/1evy21o/how_do_i_get_a_fly_gemini_v3_working/
