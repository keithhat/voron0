This is from: https://www.printables.com/model/512829-voron-0-filament-latch-remix-for-no-drop-nuts-sibo/files
	- It is remixed of the LDO motors version https://www.printables.com/model/172427-voron-01-filament-latch-1515-extrusion which was based off 2.4 2020 version: https://github.com/richardjm/voron-parts/tree/main/voron-2.4/FilamentLatch

Note:
	- There are two versions here:
		- Short lengths - work with NUT in Siboor/Makerbeam 
		- Stub for no drop nuts
	- Use two per panel edge so 8 for left and 8 for right
		- Maybe spacers for middle of each
	- Door cam ise as a latch
